0.00 --> 26.00
 We were both young when I first saw you, I closed my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there

26.00 --> 36.00
 On the balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the bargowns

36.00 --> 47.00
 See you make your way through the crowd and say hello Little did I know

48.00 --> 56.00
 That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

56.00 --> 63.00
 And I was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go

63.00 --> 73.00
 And I said, Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's had to do is run

73.00 --> 82.00
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say yes

85.00 --> 95.00
 So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes

95.00 --> 108.00
 Just keep this town for a little while Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter and my daddy said stay away from Juliet

108.00 --> 115.00
 But you were everything to me I was begging you please don't go

115.00 --> 125.00
 And I said, Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's had to do is run

125.00 --> 133.00
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say yes

133.00 --> 141.00
 Romeo said baby tryna tell me how to feel This love is difficult but it's real

141.00 --> 150.00
 Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story baby just say yes

164.00 --> 172.00
 But I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around

172.00 --> 180.00
 My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town

180.00 --> 188.00
 And I said, Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you

188.00 --> 193.00
 But you never come as this in my head I don't know what to think

193.00 --> 199.00
 He nailed to the ground and pulled out a ring and said marry me Juliet

199.00 --> 206.00
 You never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know

206.00 --> 216.00
 I talk to your dad you'll pick out a white dress It's a love story baby just say yes

218.00 --> 232.00
 Oh, oh, oh, oh We were both young when I first saw you
